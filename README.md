# Data Analysis - Hotel Booking Cancellations

The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on the business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this project.


## Business Problem & Questions

1. What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How hotel reservations cancellations can be reduced?
3. How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

## Hypothesis

1. More cancellations happen when the prices are higher.
2. Longer waiting time leads customers to cancel bookings more frequently.
3. The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their
reservations.

## Conclusion & Suggestions

1. When prices increase, so do cancellation rates. Hotels should improve their pricing tactics and attempt to cut the costs for particular hotels based on locations (Portugal based hotels needs to improve much as they severly high cancellations) in order to prevent cancellations of reservations. The customers should also be provided with lucerative discounts & offers in comparision to competetors. 
2. Since resort hotels see more cancellations than city hotels do, they have a greater ratio of cancellations overall. Hence, on weekends and during holidays, hotels should offer a fair discount on room rates.
3. When cancellations are at there peaks in January, hotels can launch campaigns or marketing with a reasonable budget to reduce cancellations & boost income.
4. To lower the cancellation rate, they might also improve the quality of their accommodations and services, particularly in Portugal.
